ix: acidclouds Half-Life 2 Roleplay is a server started by me and xvrnutz, with hope to create a good and friendly enviroment for serious RP.

# Things to enhance:
- Combine HUD
- User Interface

# Contributions
Thanks for @bloodycop7 for making the main schema.

**IMPORTANT**
- Schema does NOT use netstream, use the net. library.
- localPlayer is cached Clientside, do not use LocalPlayer()
- scrW is cached Clientside, do not use ScrW()
- scrH is cached Clientside, do not use ScrH()
- The schema does not use client:IsCombine(), use Schema:IsCombine(client) instead. (Look at sh_schema to look at more code.)
